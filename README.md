## How to create your own instance

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/BrNi05/Quoteosch.git`.

For testing / development:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`.
- Build the project: `npm run build`.
- Run the generated migration(s): `npm run db:init`.
- Create your `.env`.
- Start the app (in dev mode): `npm run start:dev`.
- The `release` folder contains useful resources to host your API.

For production:

- Copy [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/BrNi05/Quoteosch/blob/main/release/docker-compose.yaml) to a desired location.
- Create your `.env`.
- For the very first time: `docker compose run --rm quoteosch-api-init`.
- Then start the API normally: `docker compose up -d quoteosch-api`.
- The `release` folder contains a script to auto-start the container on boot.

> [!TIP]
> If any changes are made to the database schema, youâ€™ll need to start the migration container again using: `docker compose run --rm quoteosch-api-init`.

## Disclaimer

Quoteosch API initially was a joke, but it evolved into a sophisticated project. It's meant for fun and not to offend anyone.
